Running the unittest Tests


    Each   of  the  python    files     has a   test   file     called
    <filename>_Test.py. These are unittests and can be run by:

        python <filename>_Test.py. 

    The unittests will check code coverage and code correctness if you
    have Coverage and PyChecker installed. To use coverage you need to
    set the evironment variable  to USECOVERAGE=1 and to use PyChecker
    you need to set USEPYCHECK=1.

    Get Coverage from: http://www.garethrees.org/2001/12/04/python-coverage/
    Get PyChecker from: http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/
